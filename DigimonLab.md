## Mikail Akbar's Digimon Lab!

I really enjoyed working on this lab. Even though this lab was similar to the practices done in previous classes, this lab offered new problems for me to solve, and an engaging dataset. 

I worked on this lab by myself. The process I used while working on the lab is as follows: I would first read what I am expected to code, and then I would go back to my other python files to serve as an inspiration for what to do. Then, I would draw a mental picture in my head of the pseudocode. For example, I ask myself: do I need a nested dictionary? Will a list suffice? Once I get that sorted in my head, I proceed to the body of my code. 

I would follow the same structure of code as my other practice methods. For example, I keep the general idea of opening a read-only CSV file, and I iterate through every entry in the dataset. 

For me, the most important aspect of this lab is being able to index into the values of the dataset/the dictionaries that I created. Understanding this general concept allowed me to complete this lab successfully.

I would say that the biggest source of errors in my code had to be when I forgot to convert from a string to a float in my code. Unfortunately, Python cannot multiply or divide a string that contains only integers, so I have to convert each string in my list to an actual number for me to manipulate the values in my dataset. 

Thank you for reading my blog! And stay updated for more labs!
